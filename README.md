# Workout-app

Objective - This page is meant to be my most mobile friendly and to teach me how to apply responsive design principles.

What I learned - In addition to using media queries for the first time, I also had to work with a dropdown menu. The problem I ran into was that it would load in the down position, which was solved by adding a command to close it before the command to open it. The options in the menu also allowed me to practice with hiding and unhiding elements based on clicks.
